## Getting Started
Enough of talking, lets get you start,
- firstly navigate to <a href="https://github.com/100-Days-of-Coding/Coding-for-100-days"> https://github.com/100-Days-of-Coding/Coding-for-100-days </a> and fork the repo
- next, clone the repository with the following command
        ``` 
        git clone -repoLink 
        ```
- next study the repository structure, TiPs, everyone's work is inside a given directory inside the root directory,
- create your own folder at the same level with everyones directory bearing your name, you can do so with the command
        ```
            mkdir Coding-for-100-days/<you-name>
        ```
- excellent if you are up to this level, go ahead and do you first task by opening the directory with your prefered text editor, so some changes.
- are you done, next check your changes with 
        ```
            git status
        ```
- stage your changes with 
        ``` 
            git add /fileChanged
        ```
- commit with 
        ```
            git commit -m "commit message"
        ```
- Awesome, we are all set, your default branch maybe main or master, if you feel you want to use this branch, then ignore the next two steps and run
        ```
            git push
        ```
- Else, create a branch and switch to it with
        ``` 
            git checkout -b contrib_branc_name
        ```
- now push to the upstream of your branch with 
        ```
            git push --set-upstream branch_name
        ```
- Congrats, your changes should be on github now, just create a pull request to the main repository of the organization
